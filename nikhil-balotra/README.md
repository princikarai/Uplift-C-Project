Tic Tac Toe is an integral part of our childhood memories. It is a fun game consisting of two players who battle each other using Xs and Os. But did you know that this game can be a good C++ project? If you program it correctly, you can have fun playing it on your PC with your friends again.
Tic-tac-toe is a game where two players X and O fill the hash (#) shaped box (consist of two vertical lines crossing two horizontal lines) with their alternate turns. The player who first fills the box with 3Xs or 3Os in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal manner will win the game.
This project is a 2-player game of tic-tac-toe. Players take turns to enter their desired row and column no. in the board. The game goes on until a player wins (has three consecutive X’s or O’s) or there is a draw. The screen outputs the result of the game.
